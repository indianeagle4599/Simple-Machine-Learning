# Simple-Machine-Learning

Welcome to the *Simple ML* repository. This repository contains very simple Machine Learning codes. The codes follow - 
1. Loading libraries and data
2. Exploring and analysing the data
3. Playing with it to engineer new, more useful features
4. Creating a Machine Learning model
5. Evaluating it to see how effective it is.

If you follow all the codes and their documentation, you will be able to understand one aspect of Machine Learning. 
You can find out what an ML Engineer does with given data, how they gain insights and try to make the best results out of it.
The codes are a mere aspect of what an ML Engineer does but it is integral for every aspiring ML Engineer to know these steps.

## About the notebooks

The notebooks belong to various aspects of ML. Some of them are classification, some regression and some supervised learning.
One of the notebooks also creates a Neural Network using Tensorflow.
The notebook names provide the topic of the model and the notebooks contain simple insights and steps needed to create a model.
